Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra and Chamber Choir. For information about the musical term, see Tafelmusik (musical term).

The Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra (also known as Tafelmusik) is a Canadian baroque orchestra specializing in early music. They often perform with choir and play on period instruments.

The orchestra was founded in 1979 by oboist Kenneth Solway and bassoonist Susan Graves. Violinist Jeanne Lamon has been its musical director since 1981 but she stepped down as Music Director of Tafelmusik in June, 2014, and is currently serving as the Chief Artistic Advisor until the next Music Director is chosen. She will continue to perform and tour with the orchestra in a reduced capacity.

The orchestra has 19 full-time members who specialize in historical performance and technique, with additional musicians joining the ensemble when required.

The Tafelmusik Chamber Choir, under the direction of Ivars Taurins, was formed in 1981 to complement the orchestra.
