Have a hike to Nuuksio Infomail

Hi!

It's amazing how many of you decided to join this trip hike!

Originally I thought it would be max ~15 hikers and ~5 staying the night, but seems like we'll be more like 30 and 10, estimations doubled!

I'm terribly sorry that everything won't go supersmooth, for example making food will take a bit longer as there is such a huge amount of us, but we'll definitely enjoy the trip.

Anyway, to the point:

I'm assuming everyone getting this email is participating in the trip, there will be food bought for each of you, please inform me today if you cancel.

Starting location has been asked a bit, so

that is where the bus leaves according to HSL, as you might read from there, it leaves at 10.40, we won't be able to wait for people who are late, would throw the hike from everyone on time, be on time. 

The hike starting time is at 10.30, I'd very much like to count you all and already start distributing food by 10.30 be there!

Then the next most asked question: Things to take with you
Day mode
Backpack, that fits all your things + some of the general food
Warm clothes (take layers, you don't want to sweat while walking, but on a break you want to put more on)
Shoes you like to walk in (waterproof, snow is wet)(I'm going with gumboots)
water, carry atleast 1litre please
A spoon, optionally also plate, fork, knife
 
5€ or mail me a recipt of the payment, to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, reciever Teepakki, message Have a Hike 'Own Name'
 
a way to pay the bus, preferrably a HSL card
 
maybe
Headlamp
Some nice own snacks/candies
toiletpaper

Night mode
Everything in daymode (surprize!)
Be really, really sure you have warm clothes, I'd like to sit by a campfire for a while...
Sleeping bag & mattress, check later chapter for borrowals
the trips cost increases to 7€
You need to be a member of either Teepakki or Hyde, atleast you have to have paid ones membership fee
Headlamp

Food
I will be buying the trips main food at Espoo centres k-supermarket, starting at roughly 9.15, would be really nice if some (a few) pop up there and help in the shop.
Really nice would be to get helping hands carrying the food over the railroad, form the k-supermarket at ~10.10
Food will be evenly distributed to everyone to carry before we start hiking and we'll have a proper lunch all together, some sandwitches for snacks and some light/small-ish dinner, in the evening we'll eat something and morning will see porridge.
I'm buying the food with a thought that that's all I will need to eat during the trip.

Of the sleeping stuff;
we have 7 bags and 6 good, 1 worse mattresses to lend, 
Atleast 5 people are getting one set each: if you know you're one of them please confirm to this mail that I've gotten it right and you want them.

Tents
I have my own 2 person and teepakkis 3 person, will bring their tents, which will mean we can easily fit everybody who stays overnight, in case of a crowd we can fit 3rd persons into 2 person tents and I might want to try sleeping outside.

so we have 2 extra bags, and 1 good and one worse mattress (it's softer, but my opinion is that it's not nearly as warm) to lend, I think I have atleast 5 people who asked to borrow these :/

we'll figure something, if you want to borrow, please respond to this mail.

Trips and hikes, like all good things have an ending;
