Südtirol radelt!
Dear members of the university community,
 
the unibz participates in the bicycle initiative of „Südtirol radelt! - L’Alto Adige pedala“.
 
It is a Green mobility initiative by STA (Südtiroler Transportstrukturen AG/Strutture trasporto Alto Adige) and Ökoinstitut Südtirol/Alto Adige, encouraging people to use the bicycle as much as possible. Sport is good for your health and good for the environment. Everybody can take part as member of an organisation or an institution.
 
I cordially invite you to join the competition and the team of unibz. Last year, we got first in the category of Education institutions thanks to our massive participation. Of course, we should be able to maintain our first position this year as well.
 
Join in straight away and register online at www.altoadigepedala.bz.it. You will be asked to indicate a team, in your case the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, and to fill in the kilometres cycled from 22nd March to 8th October 2017. Who covers more than 100 km automatically takes part in the lottery at the end of the initiative. You can also participate by downloading the app https://www.altoadigepedala.bz.it/app/. In autumn, all winners will be directly informed by the organizers.
 
In addition, the three members of the university community who will sum up the greatest number of “cycling kilometers” will receive an unibz award as acknowledgement for their athletic achievement.
 
If you have further questions please contact Alessia Perseghin, Press and Event Management: event@unibz.it.
 
Best regards
Managing Director
