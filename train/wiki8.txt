Fabiola da Silva (born June 18, 1979 in São Paulo), nicknamed Fabby, is a Brazilian professional vert skater[1] who competes on the LG Action Sports World Tour. She has received over fifty medals in the LG Action Sports World Tour events. She has received seven X Games gold medals and one silver, making her the most decorated female athlete in X Games history. In a seven-year stretch, she only lost one X Games event, finishing second in 1999.

She has been so dominant against women skaters that she forced the hand of the sport's administrators in respect of limited gender integration of the professional sport: in 2000, the Aggressive Skaters Association created the so-called "Fabiola Rule", which allowed women to compete in the formerly all-male vert competition. Since then, she has placed in the top ten several times in events where she competed against men.

In 2005, she became the first woman ever to land the double back flip on a vert ramp.

Fabiola da Silva features in the three-time Webby Award-winning Book of Cool.

She continues to pursue a world championship.
