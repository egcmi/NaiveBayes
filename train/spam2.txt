I Fucking Love Science Teams Up With The Science Channel To Curate The Best Science Content On The Web

We're teaming up with The Science Channel to bring you the best science videos online. The Science Channel's new digital television channel, Sci2, will be curated by IFLS's owner and founder, Elise Andrew. In other words, me. 

The internet is a wonderful place to learn. Every single person reading this has access to a device on which you can view almost every piece of knowledge ever collected by the human race. But let's face it, as the amount of information increases, so does the signal to noise ratio. For every fantastic science blog there are ten quack sites. For every educational and informative video, there's a crackpot on YouTube telling you that the government is trying to kill you with plastic snow.

That's why I'm so excited about this new project - there are hundreds and thousands of truly spectacular content creators out there who have little to no audience, simply because they haven't been noticed. I'm lucky enough on IFLS to have enough influence to get some of these talented people noticed - and now, by teaming up with the Science Channel, I'm hoping to be able to introduce you all to even more deserving people.

As well as curated and selected videos, there are also some great live feeds. Feel free to explore and let me know what you think!
