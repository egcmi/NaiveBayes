***

For practical reasons the scarf making takes place at Annika's place in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. You get the address by signing up by Friday 24th by replying to this email. Also let me know whether you want to make Hyde's or Teepakki's scarf, so we can estimate the amount of materials needed. If you decide to come ex tempore, call or SMS to phone number XXXXXXXXXXX on Sunday to get the address.

You can arrive any time between 15 and 19. When your scarf is ready, you can stay to help others or play board games.

Hyde scarf: Make a Hyde scarf (or neckerchief, see picture https://fi.scoutwiki.org/HYDE) by printing the patterns with a "template" and then sew it into a scarf. Hyde provides cloth and colors.

Teepakki scarf: Teepakki has bought ready blue scout scarfs. To the corner of the scarf you have to sew Teepakki's badge, see picture (https://fi.scoutwiki.org/Teepakki). You can buy the scarf (7 €) and the badge (2 €) at this event.

If you already have a scarf or you don't want to make one, you can still come to give advise to others, just hang around, play board games or whatever. There's a sewing machine for making the scarfs  (can be used for other purposes too if need be). There's a shop 1 km away, a microwave oven and oven for heating food and it's possible to order pizza, but otherwise the kitchen will be full of scarf-making equipment :) Welcome!
