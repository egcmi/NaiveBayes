TRUE
holiday property

Hello

I am emailing you as we found your holiday property at

[Source]

and would love you to list it on our website for free:

http://www.holidayrentals.org

This web site now has over 1000 holiday rentals listed in less than 2 months, so
please register and then add as many properties as you wish. All for free forever

If we have emailed you by accident because you have a bed and breakfast, hotel or
something similar then we are sorry but we cannot at present accept your properties.
We are working on a site for this purpose.


www.Self-catering-breaks.com is now becoming one of the largest sites on the internet
for people who wish to list their own properties.

We already have 1000's of properties listed but want to make sure you already have
listed your properties.

So please feel free to add your property or properties.

Firstly register and you will be emailed an authorisation key.

Thanks for your time and please pass this email onto anyone you think may be
interested to list for free.

Many thanks


Peter
