Attention Vacation Home Owner, At 1st Choice Vacation Rentals, we have one mission - help vacationers enjoy the benefits of staying in a vacation home during their treasured holidays. Since we started over 11 years ago, we've connected well over 10 million consumers to properties. We have continued to refine our process to ensure that our property owner/manager customers see their subscription to our services as the highest payback marketing investment they make. We're gratified that we've been recognized year after year as the Best of the Web by Forbes Magazine. See the review our site received: http://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/category.jhtml?id=172.

While it's nice to be recognized as having one of best designed and organized sites, we know what matters to our customers is bookings. The only way we can help you book a property is if we have enough traffic so we focus on improving that every day. For example, we regularly monitor and optimize our traffic and search engine placement:

    Type in "vacation property" on Google. We have the #1 Top Spot. Our search results are extremely high for more specific terms also.
    Our web traffic places us in the top one-tenth of 1% of all websites. See www.alexa.com for more details.
    Your listing on our site will be visible to over 10,000 visitors daily. See www.trafficestimate.com for more details.
    We know that you would like traffic to your website. The most important factor in improving your search engine placement is a link from a highly trafficked and respected traffic site such as www.choice1.com to your site so we included that in our service. 

It's been our experience that once property owners and managers experience working with 1st Choice, they come back year after year and usually increase their investment since they receive a great return on their investment. As a result, we are offering for first-time customers to experience working with us via a $99 ($149.95 Orlando/Lake Tahoe) first year offer. That's about the same as what many of us spend on lattes in a month. We are further enhancing the offer by placing your listing on two other websites -- www.iVacationRentals and www.iVacationHomes.com - without any extra fee.

If you would like to take advantage of this great offer please go to http://www.choice1.com and select "List Your Rental". Use offer code Disc905 when setting up your page, and when inputting your billing information, select the $199.95 Silver Package from the options list. ($299.95 Gold - Orlando/Tahoe) Your 50% discount will be applied when your card is processed by our billing department, and you will receive an email invoice confirming the discount. (This offer will expire October 1, 2005.)

Let me know if we can help you receive the same return on investment that thousands of our customers are receiving every day. We know you live in a competitive environment so we are passionate about ensuring that you realize the full potential of booking opportunities.

Best regards,

Brian Corrales
