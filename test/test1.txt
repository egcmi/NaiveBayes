Dear tenants in Maakaari XXX,

We hope that your exchange period and living at Hoas student apartment has been a pleasant experience.

If your tenancy period is expiring 31st of May 2017 it is possible in your address to extend the agreement until the end of June if you wish. You do not need to have a study related reason for the extension, you can just stay to enjoy the Finnish summer.

This notice concerns only exchange students.

To make the extension you need to visit Hoas Service Center in Kamppi
during 6th of March 2017 - 7th of April 2017 to sign a new agreement!
Please bring your official ID card or passport with you. Tenancy agreement can be extended if all payments are in order and there is no other reason not to.

As in these exchange student apartments the whole yearâ€™s rents are paid in 9 months, you do not need to pay any rent for June.

The extension can be done only starting from 6th of March 2017, so kindly visit Hoas only after that date. Please note that if you have not signed a new agreement by 7th of April 2017, your agreement expires according to your current tenancy agreement.

If you have any questions about the agreement extension, please do not
hesitate to contact us!

Best regards,
Heini, Jenni and Anni
