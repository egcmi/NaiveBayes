Dear all,
Everything is now ready for opening the course platform so that we can begin
the course.

*** VERY IMPORTANT: CAREFULLY READ THE TEXT BELOW BEFORE TAKING ACTION! ***

Sign in at the MOOC platform and enroll to this course. The usual University
accounts are NOT in use (this is an OPEN version of Moodle). Instead, you may
use your University email address (preferable choice!) as a username. Also
other email addresses are accepted as usernames for the MOOC platform.

The address of the course platform is:
https://mooc.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=52
(it is currently not listed anywhere, it appears under "MOOC Demos" - subject
to change)

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS HERE, please pay attention:

There is a general enrolment key "IODS-2017" that might be required when you
enroll,
BUT, more importantly, also a group key is required.

There are two options, depending on your desired level of study:

1) Doctoral/Master's level of studies: use group key "IODS-group1"
2) Bachelor's level of studies: use group key "IODS-group2"

You must choose either one! It affects the weekly peer-reviews and the final
assignment.

You will find (much) more details and instructions on the platform, when you
get there.

We will begin in the morning and give advice in order to get everyone started
with R, RStudio, GitHub etc. The classes are not lectures, but more like
interactive workshops.

If you are going to attend the classes, please bring your own computer and be
prepared to install software for it.

See you!
The teaching team: Kimmo, Tuomo, Emma, and Petteri
